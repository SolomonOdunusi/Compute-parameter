The first two lines include header files for standard input/output and mathematical functions. The '#define' statements define constants for the following:
1. Speed of light (c)
2. The frequency of the signal (f)
3. The wavelength of the signal (lambda)
4. The parameters d and a for equations 2.27 and 2.28, respectively. 
The values for these constants are based on the problem statement.

The main function defines four integer variables (start_angle, end_angle, interval and i representing the angle) to specify the range of angles and the interval between them and also defines a float variable pi to place our pie(3.14)/M_PI. Then, a for loop iterates over each angle in the specified range. Inside the loop, the angle in degrees is converted to radians using the formula theta = angle * PI / 180.0, where M_PI is a constant provided by the math library representing the value of pi.

The next four lines inside the loop compute the parameters for each of the equations using the values of theta and the constants defined earlier. The results are stored in variables v, gamma, D, and b, respectively.

Finally, the results are printed to the console using the printf function. The %d and %f format specifiers are used to print integers and floating-point numbers, respectively. The .4 precision specifier is used to print the results with four decimal places. The printf function is called four times for each angle to print the values of v, gamma, D, and b.
